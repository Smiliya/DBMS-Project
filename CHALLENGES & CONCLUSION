CHALLENGES:
   1. Error-Prone Manual Records Paper-based or spreadsheet-based record systems are highly prone to duplication, loss of data, and errors in maintaining criminal histories.
   2. Complex Relationships A single crime may involve multiple victims, witnesses, and sometimes multiple criminals. Capturing and maintaining these many-to-many
      relationships manually is difficult.
   3. Investigation Tracking Investigations are dynamic processes with start dates, end dates, statuses, and remarks. Manual systems often fail to update investigation progress in real
      time.
   4. Data Security and Integrity Crime-related data is highly sensitive. Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and security in a relational database is essential to maintain trust and compliance.

CONCLUSION:
   A Crime Records Management System offers significant benefits:
      • Efficiency: Reduces paperwork and manual record-keeping.
      • Accuracy: Eliminates duplication and minimizes errors in reporting.
      • Data Integrity: Ensures consistency and valid relationships through foreign keys.
      • Quick Access: Enables fast retrieval of records for decision-making and analysis.
      • Compliance: Helps law enforcement maintain proper documentation for legaL procedures.
Such a system not only modernizes record-keeping but also strengthens law
enforcement capabilities in solving and preventing crimes.
