CASE STUDY:
Crime Records Management System


  BACKGROUND:
      Crime records management is a critical task for law enforcement agencies.Traditional methods often involve manual record-keeping, which is time-consuming,
error-prone, and inefficient. With the rise in criminal cases and the need for quickaccess to accurate information, there is a strong demand for a database-driven Crime
Records Management System.The proposed database system will store details about criminals, crimes, victims,witnesses, investigations, and police stations. This centralized database will enable
law enforcement officers to quickly retrieve, update, and analyze crime-relatedinformation, improving both efficiency and decision-making.


  PROJECT SCOPE:
      The scope of this project is to design and implement a relational database that can handle multiple aspects of crime data. The system will:
              • Store information about criminals, crimes, victims, police stations,investigations, and witnesses.
              • Establish relationships between crimes and related entities (criminals, victims,witnesses, investigations).
              • Ensure data consistency through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and normalization.
              • Provide accurate and quick retrieval of information for reporting and analysis.
