NORMALIZATION: 

  First Normal Form (1NF):
    • All attributes hold atomic values (no repeating groups).
    • Example: Instead of storing multiple victim names in one column, each victimhas a separate row in VictimDetails.
  Second Normal Form (2NF):
    • All non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
    • Example: In CrimeRecord, attributes like Type_of_Crime, Location, Date,and Description are fully dependent on Crime_ID (the primary key).
  Third Normal Form (3NF):
    • No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes).
    • Example: In CriminalDetails, Contact_Number depends only on Criminal_ID and not on Name or Address. Similarly, in PoliceStation, Officer_in_Charge depends only on Station_ID.
  Thus, the database design satisfies 3NF, ensuring data integrity, minimal
  redundancy, and efficient querying
